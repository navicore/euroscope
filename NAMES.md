# Module Name Candidates

## Selected Name: **Trace** âœ“

Strong, direct, single syllable. What oscilloscopes do.

## Other Candidates Considered

### Strong & Simple
- **Sweep** - the scanning motion
- **Beam** - CRT electron beam reference
- **Scope** - direct, confident

### Playful/Clever
- **Phosphor** - old CRT screen glow (nostalgic, technical)
- **Glint** - catching light/signals
- **Glimpse** - seeing waveforms briefly
- **Witness** - observing your patches
- **Persist** - core feature + CRT phosphor persistence

### Dual-channel themed
- **Duet** - two channels in harmony
- **Parallax** - viewing from two perspectives
- **Mirror** - comparing reflections

### Serge/Buchla vibes (abstract/poetic)
- **Aperture** - opening to see through
- **Horizon** - where waves meet
- **Clarity** - cutting through chaos

### Technical/nerdy
- **Lissajous** - XY mode patterns (future feature)

---

**Decision rationale**: Trace fits the Eurorack naming tradition (Maths, Peaks, Rings, Ears) - simple, functional, evocative.
